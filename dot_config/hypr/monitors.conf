# Monitor Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: The settings below are examples from the original user's setup.
# They will likely NOT match your display setup!
#
# To fix display issues (cut-off screen, wrong resolution):
# 1. Run: hyprctl monitors  (to see your connected monitors and their names)
# 2. Edit this file with your actual monitor names and preferred resolutions
#
# Format: monitor=NAME,RESOLUTION@REFRESHRATE,POSITION,SCALE
#
# Common examples:
# monitor=,preferred,auto,1                    # Auto-detect (recommended for first-time setup)
# monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1             # Laptop internal display
# monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1          # External HDMI monitor
# monitor=DP-1,2560x1440@144,0x0,1             # External DisplayPort monitor
#
# For multiple monitors, set position to place them side by side:
# monitor=DP-1,2560x1440@144,0x0,1             # Left monitor
# monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,2560x0,1       # Right monitor (starts at x=2560)

# DEFAULT: Auto-detect all monitors (safest for first boot)
# Comment this out and uncomment specific settings below once you know your setup
monitor=,preferred,auto,1

# Original user's specific setup (disabled by default):
# Uncomment and modify these if they match your setup
# monitor=eDP-1,1920x1200@60,0x0,1
# monitor=DP-1,2560x1440@144,1920x0,1
# monitor=HDMI-A-1,3840x2160@60,4480x0,1
